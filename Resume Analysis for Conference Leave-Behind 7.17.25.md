The analysis incorporates an in-depth understanding of her professional background and translates her diverse experiences into core competencies highly valued within the pharmaceutical industry.

## **1\. Executive Summary: The Sales-Driven Value Proposition of Faith Miller-Sethi**

Faith Miller-Sethi, holding a DrPH and MPH, presents as a uniquely qualified strategic leader with a demonstrated capacity for driving significant revenue and market expansion within complex healthcare ecosystems. Her professional identity as a "Strategic Health Equity & Social Impact Leader" 1 is not a divergence from a commercial path but rather a distinct advantage. This background provides a profound understanding of patient needs, healthcare system dynamics, and public health trends, which are invaluable assets in the pharmaceutical sales landscape. Her advanced academic credentials lend a scientific credibility that can foster deeper, more consultative engagements with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and key opinion leaders (KOLs). This positions her as a trusted partner capable of discussing clinical data and patient outcomes, moving beyond mere product features to broader system-level impact.

A critical aspect of her commercial aptitude is evident from her tenure at mySidewalk, Inc. As Director of Strategic Health Initiatives, she successfully "landed C-suite decisionmaker meetings in the largest health systems in the U.S." and was instrumental in "driving at least $20 million new revenue".1 This directly showcases her ability to identify and penetrate new markets, cultivate high-level relationships, and close high-value deals. Furthermore, her prior experience as a Real Estate Professional, where she "consistently exceeded goals, leveraging entrepreneurial ability in attracting high net worth business" 1, underscores a consistent, results-driven sales aptitude across varied sectors. This pattern of achievement reinforces her proactive and commercially oriented mindset.

## **2\. Strategic Repositioning for Pharmaceutical Sales: Bridging Public Health and Commercial Success**

Faith Miller-Sethi's extensive experience in public health, social impact, and leadership directly translates into core sales competencies essential for the pharmaceutical industry. Her expertise in "Strategic Health Equity & Social Impact" 1 and her leadership of initiatives such as "Data for Equity" 1 demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of healthcare disparities, population health needs, and systemic challenges. This foundational knowledge is directly applicable to identifying unmet medical needs, analyzing market dynamics, and strategically positioning pharmaceutical solutions within a broader public health context. This allows for a more nuanced and impactful sales approach, aligning product benefits with population health outcomes.

Her proven ability to "develop an entirely new market" 1 at mySidewalk, Inc., by leveraging a "nationwide health-systems network," signifies exceptional market analysis and penetration skills. These capabilities are crucial for successfully launching new drugs, expanding market share for existing products, and identifying new therapeutic areas. The capacity to "cultivate relationships and networks to influence and drive upstream change" 1 is a direct parallel to the strategic account management and key opinion leader (KOL) engagement required in pharmaceutical sales, where long-term relationships and influence over prescribing patterns are paramount.

The intricate nature of pharmaceutical sales often involves navigating complex regulatory environments and engaging with a diverse array of stakeholders, including physicians, hospital administrators, pharmacy directors, and payers. Faith's broad experience across non-profits, philanthropy, and both private and public sectors 1 means she has a deep understanding of the varied motivations, decision-making processes, and regulatory constraints inherent in these diverse entities. Her demonstrated ability to "drive collaboration" 1 and "cultivate strategic relationships" 1 across multiple sectors indicates a sophisticated understanding of influence and negotiation within complex systems. This prepares her to navigate the multifaceted sales cycles of the pharmaceutical industry, positioning her as a strategic partner rather than solely a product representative.

To further illustrate the direct applicability of her background, the following table maps her core skills and experiences to relevant pharmaceutical sales competencies:

## **3\. Quantifying Impact: Highlighting Achievements for Sales Roles**

Faith Miller-Sethi's professional history is rich with quantifiable achievements that directly translate into a compelling narrative for pharmaceutical sales. Her tenure at mySidewalk, Inc., stands out as a prime example of her commercial prowess. In this role, she "drove at least $20 million new revenue" 1 by successfully "developing an entirely new market" and "landing C-suite decisionmaker meetings in the largest health systems in the U.S.".1 This demonstrates a clear aptitude for identifying lucrative opportunities, penetrating new market segments, and closing high-value deals with top-tier clients. This experience directly mirrors the objectives of pharmaceutical sales, which often involve market expansion and high-value account management.

Further reinforcing her sales capabilities, her success as a Real Estate Professional, where she "consistently exceeded goals, leveraging entrepreneurial ability in attracting high net worth business" 1, highlights a consistent track record of exceeding sales targets and a proactive, results-oriented approach to client acquisition. Her leadership in developing an "innovative proposal in pursuit of a $1 million grant" 1 at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene further showcases her capacity for high-value business development and securing significant funding, a skill directly analogous to securing large contracts or formulary approvals in the pharmaceutical sector.

Her role as Clinical Professor at CUNY School of Medicine provides powerful metrics demonstrating her ability to build and leverage relationships for tangible growth and expansion. She "increased field site placements 84% by establishing 46 strategic partnerships".1 This achievement directly illustrates her capacity for business development, client acquisition, and partnership management, skills crucial for growing a sales territory or gaining formulary access for pharmaceutical products. Her proven ability to "cultivate high level relationships at the biggest health systems in the U.S." 1 and to "procure and cultivate strategic relationships with key internal and external stakeholders" 1 speaks to her exceptional prowess in key account management and building long-term, influential partnerships that drive sustained business. The extension of her NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene contract for "five more years based on performance" 1 further underscores her sustained excellence and ability to deliver client satisfaction, a critical aspect of repeat business and territory growth in sales.

Faith's capacity to drive "upstream change" and secure "C-suite decisionmaker meetings" 1 indicates a strategic sales capability that extends beyond transactional interactions. In pharmaceutical sales, influencing "upstream change" involves impacting prescribing guidelines, formulary decisions, or hospital protocols. This requires engaging with and influencing high-level stakeholders such as hospital executives, pharmacy and therapeutics committees, and medical directors. Her proven ability to access and influence these top-tier decision-makers demonstrates a strategic sales acumen, indicating she can navigate complex organizational hierarchies and drive systemic adoption of products. This positions her for complex, high-impact pharmaceutical sales roles that require a deep understanding of healthcare systems and a sophisticated approach to influence.

The following table summarizes her most impactful achievements, rephrased to emphasize their commercial relevance and quantifiable impact for a pharmaceutical sales context:

### **Table 2: Quantifiable Achievements for Sales Impact**

## **4\. Tailoring Experience: Crafting a Pharmaceutical Sales Narrative**

To effectively position Faith Miller-Sethi for pharmaceutical sales, specific roles and responsibilities must be selected and articulated to resonate with recruiters, emphasizing client engagement, relationship building, and product/solution advocacy.

The experience at mySidewalk, Inc., is paramount and should be featured prominently due to its direct commercial outcomes within the health sector. The "Director of Strategic Health Initiatives" role 1 directly highlights her ability to generate revenue, develop new markets, and engage with C-suite executives.1 This experience provides the most direct evidence of her sales capabilities in a relevant industry.

Her role as a "Real Estate Professional" 1 should be included to demonstrate transferable sales skills. This showcases a consistent track record of exceeding goals in a commission-based environment, emphasizing her "entrepreneurial ability in attracting high net worth business".1 This provides a concrete example of direct sales success outside the public health sphere.

Leadership roles at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 1 and CUNY School of Medicine 1, while not explicitly sales positions, are critical for demonstrating leadership, project management, and relationship-building skills essential for navigating complex sales environments. For her role at NYC DOHMH, the description of "Lead Data for Equity internal reform initiative" 1 should be reframed to emphasize strategic planning, execution, and influence over a large stakeholder group (over 850 staff).1 This demonstrates a capacity for managing a large "territory" or client base, coordinating complex initiatives, and driving adoption across a broad organization. Similarly, when discussing her academic roles, the emphasis should be on her ability to "cultivate relationships with groups and providers" 1 and the quantifiable achievement of "increased field site placements 84% by establishing 46 strategic partnerships".1 These accomplishments translate directly into business development, client acquisition, and partnership management skills.

Furthermore, her stated "expertise in managing project development, operational delivery, and marketing activities across multi-disciplinary teams" 1 is directly applicable to managing a pharmaceutical sales territory, coordinating product launches, and executing marketing strategies within a sales context.

It is also important to consider the implications of her "contract" roles. While some might perceive contract work as less stable, in Faith's case, it highlights her ability to quickly integrate into new environments, deliver measurable results, and secure renewals or extensions based on performance. The extension of her NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene contract for "five more years based on performance" 1 is a strong indicator of sustained client satisfaction, value delivery, and a proven ability to "close" on continued business. This is a direct parallel to client retention and growth in sales. It also demonstrates her adaptability and proactive approach to career management, showcasing a candidate who consistently delivers and builds lasting relationships. These successes should be framed as proof of immediate impact, high performance, and the ability to build enduring client relationships, rather than simply a series of temporary assignments.

## **5\. Crafting a Compelling Sales Narrative: Language and Keywords**

To maximize the impact of the leave-behind, the language must be strategically adapted to a sales-centric vocabulary, incorporating industry-specific keywords and maintaining a persuasive tone.

Public health or academic jargon should be replaced with commercial terms. For instance, instead of describing "program strategies," the language should shift to "market strategies" or "sales initiatives." The phrase "cultivated relationships" can be rephrased as "developed client pipelines" or "managed key accounts." The narrative should employ strong action verbs that convey direct sales impact, such as *Generated, Drove, Secured, Expanded, Negotiated, Closed, Accelerated, Optimized, Penetrated, and Launched*. The focus must consistently be on quantifiable outcomes rather than merely describing activities; the emphasis should be on what was *achieved* (e.g., revenue, market share, partnerships) rather than simply what was *done*.

Integrating pharmaceutical industry keywords is crucial for demonstrating industry awareness and fit. While Faith's current resume does not explicitly use these terms, her experience provides a strong foundation for understanding their implications. The leave-behind should subtly weave in terms such as *Market Access, Formulary, Key Opinion Leader (KOL) engagement, Territory Management, Product Launch, Clinical Data, Patient Outcomes, HCP (Healthcare Professional) engagement, CRM (Customer Relationship Management), Sales Cycle, and ROI (Return on Investment)* where appropriate. This demonstrates that she understands the lexicon and operational realities of pharmaceutical sales.

The overall tone of the leave-behind must be confident, assertive, and results-oriented. As a sales document for herself, it should begin with a powerful, sales-oriented headline that immediately captures her unique value proposition, potentially leveraging her DrPH/MPH as a distinct competitive advantage. Every statement within the document must contribute to the overarching sales narrative, clearly demonstrating how her skills and experience will directly benefit a pharmaceutical company. The document should not merely list achievements but tell a concise story of Faith as a strategic problem-solver who consistently delivers measurable commercial results within complex healthcare environments. Her background indicates an ability to solve complex problems, whether related to health equity, data modernization, or market development. In a sales context, this translates to solving client problems such as unmet medical needs or market access barriers. Her demonstrated capacity to "influence and drive upstream change" 1 signifies an ability to impact the root causes of commercial challenges. This narrative positions her as a strategic asset who can not only sell products but also understand broader market and client challenges, offering more sophisticated solutions than a typical sales representative and positioning her for higher-level, more strategic sales roles within the pharmaceutical industry.

## **6\. Designing the Conference Leave-Behind: Impact and Conciseness**

The conference leave-behind is a critical marketing tool designed to pique interest and secure a follow-up conversation, rather than serving as a comprehensive resume summary. Its primary goal is to highlight potential and fit for pharmaceutical sales, not to provide exhaustive detail. Therefore, its design must prioritize impact and conciseness.

The document must be extremely concise, ideally limited to one page, with a maximum of two, given its purpose for quick consumption in a busy conference environment. A visually appealing, clean layout with ample white space is essential for scannability. The use of strong headings and bullet points will enhance readability at a glance. A slightly larger font size than a traditional resume may also be beneficial for quick readability.

Key content elements for the leave-behind include:

* **Prominent Contact Information:** Faith Miller-Sethi, DrPH, MPH, along with her phone number (201.658.2698), email (faithmiller@gmail.com), and LinkedIn profile URL ([linkedin.com/in/faith-miller-sethi-drph-mph](https://linkedin.com/in/faith-miller-sethi-drph-mph)).1 This ensures recruiters can easily follow up.  
* **Compelling Headline/Summary:** A powerful, sales-oriented headline that immediately captures her unique value proposition (e.g., "DrPH & MPH Driving $20M+ Revenue in Healthcare Market Development"). This should be a refined version of her current "STRATEGIC HEALTH EQUITY & SOCIAL IMPACT LEADER".1  
* **"Why Pharma Sales?" Statement (Optional but Recommended):** A very brief (1-2 sentences) statement explaining her pivot to pharmaceutical sales, leveraging her public health background as a distinct asset. This proactively addresses potential questions regarding her career transition.  
* **Key Achievements (Quantified & Sales-Focused):** This is the core of the document. The rephrased achievements from Table 2 should be presented, focusing on 3-5 of her most impactful, quantifiable sales-relevant accomplishments.  
* **Relevant Experience Highlights:** Select 2-3 of her most relevant roles (mySidewalk, Real Estate, NYC DOHMH) and distill them into 1-2 concise bullet points each, specifically focusing on sales-transferable responsibilities and outcomes.  
* **Education & Credentials:** Briefly list her DrPH, MPH, and Duke BA.1 The DrPH/MPH should be highlighted as a unique credibility builder within the pharmaceutical context.  
* **Call to Action:** A subtle invitation to connect on LinkedIn or visit her profile for more detailed information.

For visual presentation and professionalism, consistent branding (if applicable) and a polished, professional aesthetic are crucial. A QR code linking directly to her LinkedIn profile or a more detailed online portfolio can enhance accessibility. Finally, meticulous proofreading for any errors is non-negotiable to maintain a professional image. The leave-behind is designed for a quick scan (30-60 seconds) that leaves a strong impression and clearly communicates her value proposition for pharmaceutical sales, prompting the recruiter to connect further. It needs to be visually distinct and impactful to stand out among many other materials collected at a conference.
